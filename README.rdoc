= LocalVimrc

Just sources the .vimrc file from whatever directory you open vim in. Used for
project specific vim options.

ex. One Projects convention is to use hard tabs instead of soft tabs. Create a .vimrc file in the project directory and set the hard tab options.

Always open vim from the project route

* Create .vimrc in project route: ex. /project/.vimrc
* Always open vim from the project route: ex. mvim /project
* Profit.
